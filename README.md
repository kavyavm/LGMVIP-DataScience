This repository contains the tasks I completed as a Data Science intern at Let'sGrowMore.  

Task 1 - Iris Flower Classification ML Project  

This Particular ML Project is usually referred to as the "Hello World" of Machine Learning. The Iris Flowers dataset contains numeric attributes and is perfect for beginners to learn about supervised ML algorithms, mainly how to load and handle data. Also since this is a small dataset, it can easily fit in memory without requiring special transformations or scaling capabilities.

Task 4 - Prediction Using Decision Tree Algorithm.  

1. For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.
2. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
